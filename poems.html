                        I am captive, drowning rapidly <br>
                        I am a prisoner of my dreams<br>
                        The truth never being what it seems<br> 
                        My passions cry out wanting to be free <br>
                        Pain is an obstruction haunting me <br>
                        While trials to purify my soul clean<br>
                        Are disillusioned by wasted means<br>
                        Survival has curtailed my reality<br>
                        I am prisoner of deception<br>
                        Left alone to cry<br>
                        I am a captive of perceptions<br>
                        Trapped with questions of why<br>
                        I am slowly sinking pulled by bait<br>
                        While time for me, will not wait<br>
                        </div>

                    <div class="bodytext poem">

                        <span class="poemtitle">You Can't Stop My Shine</span><p>
                        I wish I could write a different script<br>
                        One where I believe in me<br>
                        And trust the Creator<br>
                        Using His love as an elevator<br>
                        To elevate to a higher level<br>
                        <br>
                        I wish I could write a different script<br>
                        One Where I am whole<br>
                        Not sliced to pieces<br>
                        Unable to see my choices<br>
                        <br>
                        I wish I could write a different script<br>
                        One where I am able to see pass the darkness<br>
                        That blackens my heart and soul<br>
                        Making me inhuman<br>
                        Making me unfit<br>
                        So I can fit into a cancerous mold<br>

                        Why do I create my destiny <br>
                        based on a history <br>
                        of lies I sold<br>
                        I am the beauty I stole<br>

                        I am the Queen<br>
                        The Warrior<br>
                        The Conqueror<br>
                        The anything <br>
                        and the everything <br>
                        And I Can't Forget<br>
                        And I Won't Forget<br>
                        I CAN write a different script<br>

                    <span class="poemtitle">The Feast</span><p>
                    Social Statuses<br>
                    overly baked with racist attitudes<br>
                    crusting over and under the filing<br>
                    leaving the feeling....<br>
                    straddling us into believing<br> 
                    the chains are still here<br>
                    sentenced to a life of strife<br>
                    imprisoned by our empty visions<br>
                    What is your story?<br>
                    The activist whose time in the light is drained in the golden hues of the setting sun<br>
                    energy of the present unwinding<br>
                    the force of what was done<br>
                    What is your story?<br>
                    The child who soaked and bathed in the glory of the risk takers<br>
                    risking their lives...dying for our life<br>
                    The dreamer<br>
                    The visionary<br>
                    Activism breathing life into veins<br>
                    Taking its course for a life charged<br>
                    Working to remind... <br>
                    Working to remember when sobering reality hits....<br>
                    it was all not in vain<br>
                    What is your story?<br>
                    The angry<br>
                    Dreams Shut Down<br>
                    Ensnared into redundant cycles of victimization<br>
                    punishing you without knowing you<br>
                    Used as a weapon<br>
                    to remind...<br>
                    What happens to a dream deferred...<br>
                    Victim...<br>
                    to hope lost<br>
                    to recycled lies<br>
                    promise<br>
                    lacerated<br>
                    time squeezed<br>
                    laced with feasts of fury<br>
                    tastes sourly sweet<br>
                    fury mounting upon fury<br>
                    Truth and Justice for All?<br>
                    Lying...in tuned...<br>
                    Waiting to consume<br>
                    What is your story?<br>
                    Disconnected from all<br>
                    Throw it Up! Throw it Up!<br>
                    That's how we ball out!<br>
                    Wind Chasing You<br>
                    Above it all<br>
                    that's how YOU ball<br>
                    Rollin' <br>
                    carried by shallow currents<br>
                    money driven blinds healing purpose<br>
                    Feeding from satan's sweetest intoxicants<br>
                    What is your story?<br>
                    Is it untold?<br>
                    DId it fold?<br>
                    Or does it lay...<br>
                    Submissively waiting for its day<br>
